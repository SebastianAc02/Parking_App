 # Parking Lot Dashboard

This project is a parking lot dashboard built using Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications. The dashboard allows users to interact with a parking lot simulation, add cars to specific parking spaces, and visualize the occupancy of the parking lot using a custom graph.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SebastianAc02/Parking_App

## Usage

1. Run the application:


2. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8050` to access the parking lot dashboard.

3. Use the dropdown select to switch between different sections of the parking lot (e.g., Space A, Space B).

4. Enter the license plate and select the vehicle type (Car or Bike) in the input fields.

5. Click the "Done" button to add the car to the specified parking space.

6. The parking lot graph will update to reflect the new car's position in the parking lot.

7. The table below the graph will display the parking lot occupancy data in a tabular format.
